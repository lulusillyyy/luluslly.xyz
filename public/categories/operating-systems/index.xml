      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be straight to the point: Last Saturday I purchased the M4 Macbook Pro. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really had the full Mac experience before &amp;ndash; I had only used a late 2000s unibody Macbook with a broken trackpad and dead battery running High Sierra. I already own a decent amount of Windows machines (with the majority being laptops), but my most used devices were Apple devices. My iPhone 12, my numerous iPads, and even my now-broken  pair of Airpods Max.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
