Not an instant classic, but simply an expression of my feelings.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>i yearn to be with another being
a lifelog bond where our memories and experiences intertwine
our sorrows, our joy, our anger
all together
a collective conscious
our deaths will leave behind our souls to dwell in the people we touched
the people we helped, the people we knew and loved
that will be our legacy
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></description></item></channel></rss>
