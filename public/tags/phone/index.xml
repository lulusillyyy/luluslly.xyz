      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday night I decided out of curiosity to try the swipe type feature found in most modern mobile operating systems. Swipe type, to be brief, allows you to take your finger and glide it across your phone&amp;rsquo;s on-screen keyboard without removing your finger from the screen; this allows you to form words and sentences without having to manually type out every single word by hand &amp;ndash; or I guess in this case, thumb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
