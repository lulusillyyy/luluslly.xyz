One of the things I have put a decent amount of work into has been my daily-use keyboard layout. Seeing as I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen hook, line, and sinker for the ergonomic keyboard craze, I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a relatively comfortable setup using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata"&gt;Kanata&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanata &amp;ndash; in simple terms &amp;ndash; is a &lt;strong&gt;keyboard remapper&lt;/strong&gt;. You can configure your keyboard to execute certain commands when a specific sequence of keys are pressed, do one-to-one remaps, and set up layers to allow you to access keys that would otherwise be a pain in the ass to enter traditionally.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On Getting My First Split Mechanical Keyboard</title><link>https://luluslly.xyz/post/2025/08/02/on-getting-my-first-split-mech-keyboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://luluslly.xyz/post/2025/08/02/on-getting-my-first-split-mech-keyboard/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://luluslly.xyz/images/apple_setup.webp" alt="Image of a dark room with an Apple M4 MacBook Pro and 11th generation iPad A16with their screens on showing content and a split mechanical keyboard sitting between the MacBook's trackpad"&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I finally got my first split, columnar, mechanical keyboard. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively cheap one I found on Aliexpress, which you can find &lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008486363216.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="glazing-the-keyboard"&gt;Glazing the Keyboard&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I got it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working developing a sufficiently comfortable keyboard layout using only the 36 keys I&amp;rsquo;ve been allotted. Surprisingly, it&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as I originally figured it might be. Unlike my Alice-style keyboard I bought a while back, I have full &lt;a href="https://get.vial.today"&gt;Vial/QMK support&lt;/a&gt;. This is very beneficial to me since I absolutely require my &lt;a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods"&gt;home row mods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap_dance"&gt;tap dance&lt;/a&gt; thumb keys to access all the necessary layers/modifier keys I use on a daily basis. It&amp;rsquo;s quite comfortable to use since I can slot it on the wrist rests on my laptops and still have room to use the trackpad for longer periods of mouse navigation (if only the mouse navigation layer were even &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; more comfortable!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
