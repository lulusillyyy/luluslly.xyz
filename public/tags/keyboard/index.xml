&lt;p>I finally got my first split, columnar, mechanical keyboard. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively cheap one I found on Aliexpress, which you can find &lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008486363216.html">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ever since I got it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working developing a sufficiently comfortable keyboard layout using only the 36 keys I&amp;rsquo;ve been allotted. Surprisingly, it&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as I originally figured it might be. Unlike my Alice-style keyboard I bought a while back, I have full &lt;a href="https://get.vial.today">Vial/QMK support&lt;/a>. This is very beneficial to me since I absolutely require my &lt;a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">home row mods&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap_dance">tap dance&lt;/a> thumb keys to access all the necessary layers/modifier keys I use on a daily basis. It&amp;rsquo;s quite comfortable to use since I can slot it on the wrist rests on my laptops and still have room to use the trackpad for longer periods of mouse navigation (if only the mouse navigation layer were even &lt;em>slightly&lt;/em> more comfortable!)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
