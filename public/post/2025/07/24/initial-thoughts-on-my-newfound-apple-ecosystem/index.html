I hadn&rsquo;t really had the full Mac experience before—I had only used a late 2000s unibody MacBook with a broken trackpad and a dead battery running High Sierra. I already own a decent amount of Windows machines (with the majority being laptops), but my most used devices were Apple products: my iPhone 12, my numerous iPads, and even my now-broken pair of AirPods Max.</p><img src=/images/yotsuba_headphones.jpg alt="Yotsuba wearing a pair of headphones and holding the ear pads in her hands."><p>My first impressions were something along the lines of:</p><blockquote><p>Oh wow, this device is expensive! And it actually feels nice to hold and use! Let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t break within the week!</p></blockquote><img src=/images/mac_and_airpods_box.webp alt="The Apple packaging of the 14 inch M4 MacBook Pro and Airpods 4 Active Noise Cancelling"><p>In all seriousness, the finish of the MacBook Pro is very good. It <em>feels</em> like a premium device and has given me zero problems—aside from the screen attracting fingerprints like a moth to a flame. I appreciate having a backlit keyboard for the first time since I originally got the old broken MacBook over a year ago. I find that the screen is the best out of any laptop I&rsquo;ve ever had. Apple seems to always find a way to make their devices look so <em>pretty</em>. I can&rsquo;t help but stare sometimes at the clean, uniform UI and the clear, crisp text from a web page I&rsquo;m looking at. It all feels so right.
Now, after saying all this, you may presume I impulse bought this thing purely for aesthetic pleasures, and you&rsquo;d be about 25% right. While I didn&rsquo;t necessarily NEED a Mac to survive another day, I <em>did</em> want to have experience with modern editions of the macOS operating system. Even more so, I wanted to have a full Apple ecosystem for maximum compatibility and productivity. I already harbored an Android/ChromeOS ecosystem with my cheap Chromebook, Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite, and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra—the latter of which created a crater in my pocket that I still have lingering regrets about. I always had an iPad and later an iPhone, but the Mac was elusive. The ability to use my iPad as not only a second monitor but also a separate extension of macOS using Universal Control was too enticing. Once I caved and made the purchase, I planned on getting the 11th generation iPad to have an almost fully USB-C device lineup, with the exception being my now-legacy iPhone 12. With the power of student discounts and a $100 Apple gift card, I was able to get a comfortable iPad setup with the Apple Pencil for all of my note-taking needs. With all these devices combined, I have completed the holy Apple trinity.</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><div style=display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;gap:10px;flex-wrap:wrap><img src=/images/think_different_powered_by_mac.gif alt="Think Different Powered by Mac" class=footer-gif>
