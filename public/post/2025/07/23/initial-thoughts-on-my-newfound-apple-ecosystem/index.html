    <p>I&rsquo;ll be straight to the point: Last Saturday, I purchased the M4 MacBook Pro. I hadn&rsquo;t really had the full Mac experience before—I had only used a late 2000s unibody MacBook with a broken trackpad and a dead battery running High Sierra. I already own a decent amount of Windows machines (with the majority being laptops), but my most used devices were Apple products: my iPhone 12, my numerous iPads, and even my now-broken pair of AirPods Max.</p>

<p>My first impressions were something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh wow, this device is expensive! And it actually feels nice to hold and use! Let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t break within the week!</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="todo-add-image-of-m4-macbook-pro-with-the-airpods">TODO: Add image of M4 MacBook Pro with the AirPods</h4>
<p>In all seriousness, the finish of the MacBook Pro is very good. It <em>feels</em> like a premium device and has given me zero problems—aside from the screen attracting fingerprints like a moth to a flame. I appreciate having a backlit keyboard for the first time since I originally got the old broken MacBook over a year ago. I find that the screen is the best out of any laptop I&rsquo;ve ever had. Apple seems to always find a way to make their devices look so <em>pretty</em>. I can&rsquo;t help but stare sometimes at the clean, uniform UI and the clear, crisp text from a web page I&rsquo;m looking at. It all feels so right.
Now, after saying all this, you may presume I impulse bought this thing purely for aesthetic pleasures, and you&rsquo;d be about 25% right. While I didn&rsquo;t necessarily NEED a Mac to survive another day, I <em>did</em> want to have experience with modern editions of the macOS operating system. Even more so, I wanted to have a full Apple ecosystem for maximum compatibility and productivity. I already harbored an Android/ChromeOS ecosystem with my cheap Chromebook, Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite, and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra—the latter of which created a crater in my pocket that I still have lingering regrets about. I always had an iPad and later an iPhone, but the Mac was elusive. The ability to use my iPad as not only a second monitor but also a separate extension of macOS using Universal Control was too enticing. Once I caved and made the purchase, I planned on getting the 11th generation iPad to have an almost fully USB-C device lineup, with the exception being my now-legacy iPhone 12. With the power of student discounts and a $100 Apple gift card, I was able to get a comfortable iPad setup with the Apple Pencil for all of my note-taking needs. With all these devices combined, I have completed the holy Apple trinity.</p>
