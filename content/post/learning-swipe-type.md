Yesterday night I decided out of curiosity to try the swipe type feature found in most modern mobile operating systems. Swipe type, to be brief, allows you to take your finger and glide it across your phone's on-screen keyboard without removing your finger from the screen; this allows you to form words and sentences without having to manually type out every single word by hand -- or I guess in this case, thumb.

AI blurb:
> Gesture typing, also known as swipe or glide typing, is a method of text input on touchscreen devices where you type words by sliding your finger across the keyboard, rather than tapping each individual key. It's a feature on both Android and iOS devices and is generally enabled through the keyboard's settings.

This feature uses the phone's built in predictive text functionality to allow for words to be interpreted and the best guess to be spat out. 

I took a simple MonkeyType test to see how fast I could type after only having started using this input method for about an hour:

    <source src="/images/swipe_type_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Normally tapping to type puts me a little above at ~60 words per minute -- quite ironic when you consider the fact that the average computer user that can touch type types around that speed.

I asked a couple of people in chats I frequent which input method they use primarily. Most either used swipe type or never heard of the feature at all. I don't know many if ANY people IRL that know about gesture typing, let alone prefer it.
