As of late, I have been working on keeping up-to-date repositories of my various configuration files, which can now be viewed on my [Forgejo instance](https://git.luluslly.xyz/lulusilly/). One of the things I have put a decent amount of work into has been my daily-use keyboard layout. Seeing as I've fallen hook, line, and sinker for the ergonomic keyboard craze, I've come up with a relatively comfortable setup using the [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) program.

Kanata -- in simple terms -- is a **keyboard remapper**. You can configure your keyboard to execute certain commands when a specific sequence of keys are pressed, do one-to-one remaps, and set up layers to allow you to access keys that would otherwise be a pain in the ass to enter traditionally.

As I've been privy to Kanata for some months now, my configuration has changed quite a bit as I've learned the extent to which I can utilize layering and key chords.
