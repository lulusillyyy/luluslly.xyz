I'll be straight to the point: Last Saturday, I purchased the M4 MacBook Pro. I hadn't really had the full Mac experience before—I had only used a late 2000s unibody MacBook with a broken trackpad and a dead battery running High Sierra. I already own a decent amount of Windows machines (with the majority being laptops), but my most used devices were Apple products: my iPhone 12, my numerous iPads, and even my now-broken pair of AirPods Max.

My first impressions were something along the lines of:

> Oh wow, this device is expensive! And it actually feels nice to hold and use! Let's hope it doesn't break within the week!

In all seriousness, the finish of the MacBook Pro is very good. It *feels* like a premium device and has given me zero problems—aside from the screen attracting fingerprints like a moth to a flame. I appreciate having a backlit keyboard for the first time since I originally got the old broken MacBook over a year ago. I find that the screen is the best out of any laptop I've ever had. Apple seems to always find a way to make their devices look so *pretty*. I can't help but stare sometimes at the clean, uniform UI and the clear, crisp text from a web page I'm looking at. It all feels so right.
Now, after saying all this, you may presume I impulse bought this thing purely for aesthetic pleasures, and you'd be about 25% right. While I didn't necessarily NEED a Mac to survive another day, I *did* want to have experience with modern editions of the macOS operating system. Even more so, I wanted to have a full Apple ecosystem for maximum compatibility and productivity. I already harbored an Android/ChromeOS ecosystem with my cheap Chromebook, Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite, and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra—the latter of which created a crater in my pocket that I still have lingering regrets about. I always had an iPad and later an iPhone, but the Mac was elusive. The ability to use my iPad as not only a second monitor but also a separate extension of macOS using Universal Control was too enticing. Once I caved and made the purchase, I planned on getting the 11th generation iPad to have an almost fully USB-C device lineup, with the exception being my now-legacy iPhone 12. With the power of student discounts and a $100 Apple gift card, I was able to get a comfortable iPad setup with the Apple Pencil for all of my note-taking needs. With all these devices combined, I have completed the holy Apple trinity.
