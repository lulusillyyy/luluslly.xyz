Heya everyone. Long time, no see.

I realize that I haven't published a single blog post since September, which is something I do honestly feel really bad about. This site is meant to be an extension of my thoughts and feelings, painted onto a digital canvas of sorts. It kinda defeats the purpose of maintaining a web server and taking up precious bandwidth and hard drive storage space if you're not doing anything with it, right? I think the least I could do is be transparent and let you guys know what I've been up to in the mean time.

First, and most pressing: *I have a job now!* 

When I originally set up this site, I had just graduated from my local university, fresh out of the education system. I had already been looking for full-time positions prior, but my number of applications rose as I had no impedance from classes. I interned over the summer, and got a few interviews. Skip all the boring details and now I got a full-time job working in the computer field. It's not the most engaging or complex gig, but I get money out of it and enough freedom to not go insane.

In terms of my plans for this site, I want to continue writing blog posts and provide updates like this. I already have some posts that I'm still working on, so expect some stuff down the pipeline.

I have also been working on my home server setup incrementally within the past two or so months. This site currently sits on the primary Dell laptop I have heading my Proxmox cluster, being broadcasted to the wider interwebs over a reverse proxy over Tailscale. I also managed to procure two managed network switches for a fully wired infra. I got something else up, but the time to discuss that will come in due time...

Until then, I'll see you around. Stay safe and stay free.
