Many people seem to forget the idea behind self hosting and why is is the go-to answer in discussions on "free speech" alternatives to popular online platforms like X, Reddit, YouTube. The reason as to why that one nerd online tells you to provision your old laptop or desktop as a simple home server is because it is the only logical way to have digital autonomy in the modern day.

When you do something as simple as watch a YouTube video, you are being fed a stream of data coming from Google's servers. That means *they* control what you can or cannot stream to your device. This extends to the comment system, where channel owners and YouTube moderators -- bot or otherwise -- are able to censor and completely remove dissenting opinions and any kind of wrongthink.

This same principle of free speech and data ownership applies to most -- if not all -- modern social media platforms. FaceBook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter): All of these sites have the ability to do whatever they want with whatever you upload to their sites.
